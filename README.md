# Telecom-Churn Retention Project

Problem Statement & Business context:
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become more important than customer acquisition.

For many incumbent operators, retaining highly profitable customers is the number one business goal.

To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which highly profitable customers are at risk of churn.

In this project, we will analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.

Understanding the Data:
The dataset contains customer-level information for a span of four consecutive months - June, July, August and September. The months are encoded as 6, 7, 8 and 9, respectively.

The business objective is to predict the churn in the last (i.e. the ninth) month using the data (features) from the first three months. To do this task well, understanding the typical customer behaviour during churn will be helpful.

The following steps were carried out on the dataset and data dictionary to prepare the full-scale code for building the prediction model. Let's start by:

Loading the dataset
Understanding the structure and data types
Filtering high-value customers
Tagging churners and removing churn-phase attributes
Building predictive models
Handling class imbalance
Visualizing important predictors
Recommending churn management strategies
